# LetsCompete

Some rules:
- work on branches
  - please create branch for the changes.
  - push the branch for review (create a pull-request)
  - Dont make any changes to the master directly.
- branch-naming
  - Lets differentiate them functionally - easier to understand
  - eg: sign_up, leaderboard, accout_settings
- lets have atleast 2 people review the code before merging the code to master.
- If fesable, lets coordinate the merge to master while.

Pleae do add/delete/modify above content :)
